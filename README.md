# [ MODULE : GEOSPATIAL_INTEL_SYSTEM ]

### [ MISSION_OVERVIEW ]
Implementation of an interactive visual analytics portal to assess the geographical patterns and logistical constraints of aerospace launch infrastructure. This module utilizes advanced geospatial coordinate mapping to verify asset proximities to critical transportation and maritime zones.

### [ TACTICAL_FEATURES ]
* **Proximity Protocol:** Haversine distance calculation for precise KM measurement between launch pads and coastal/transport infrastructure.
* **Interactive Clustering:** Folium-driven marker clusters to visualize high-density mission outcome data points.
* **Real-time Tracking:** MousePosition integration for dynamic target identification and coordinate extraction.
